The AStartup, or A* Star Startup, Toolkit is a Jekyll and I am You Language (IMUL) toolkit for the AStartup Cookbook, an open-source book on invent, document, launch, and run a startup on GitHub with Jekyll and I am You Language (IMUL). IMUL is a superset of Markdown use for doing timesheets, continuous integration, integrating your hand-written development logs with GitHub, building App UI mocks, timing your workout, keeping a journal, and much much more. We can help make your startup A startup with the A* Startup.

Currently right now this Toolkit only contains a basic Business Model Canvas (BMC) template and templates for a Software Design Document and Software Design Document for building an App, and a Game Design Document for building a video game. In the future we will have a physical product and a hardware product template, and a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline documentation template. Right now the Jekyll template doesn't work but I should have the BMC up and running today (2022-03-12) hopefully.

We're seeking volunteers to help us with the AStartup Cookbook and AStartup Toolkit templates.
